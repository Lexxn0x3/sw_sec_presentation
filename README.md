# Rust Software Security Features Demo 🛡️🦀

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Rust Software Security Features demonstration, presented at Technische Hochschule Georg Simon Ohm! This repo contains all the example code shown during the presentation, allowing you to dive deep into the features that make Rust a uniquely secure language for software development.

## 📖 Overview

This repository is structured to reflect the flow of the presentation, showcasing various security features in Rust through dedicated modules. Explore the code to see Rust's approach to memory safety, concurrency, and more in action!

## 📚 Contents

1. **Static Types**
   - Explore how Rust enforces type safety and the implications of signedness through the `static_types` module.
   
2. **Integer Overflow**
   - Dive into the `integer_overflow` module to see how Rust handles potential overflows and the guarantees it provides to prevent common security vulnerabilities.

3. **Zero-Cost Abstractions**
   - The `zero_cost_abstraction` module demonstrates how Rust's design patterns, like iterators and message passing, help write safe and efficient code without runtime overhead.

4. **Error Handling**
   - Rust does not have exceptions in the classical sense. See how errors are handled gracefully in the `error_handling` module, ensuring robust applications.

5. **Ownership and Borrowing**
   - One of Rust's cornerstone features is its ownership model. The `borrowing` module illustrates how Rust achieves memory safety without a garbage collector.

6. **Lifetime Tracking**
   - Understand how Rust uses lifetimes to ensure references do not outlive the data they refer to, preventing dangling references and data races.

7. **Safe Concurrency**
   - The `safe_concurrency` module shows how Rust's ownership rules extend to concurrent programming, ensuring that data races are compile-time errors.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with exploring these examples:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lexxn0x3/sw_sec_presentation.git
cd rust-security-features-demo
cargo run
```
